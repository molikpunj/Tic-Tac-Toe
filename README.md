# Tic-Tac-Toe
📝 Overview
This is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports both 1-player (against AI) and 2-player modes with responsive gameplay and score tracking.

🎮 Game Modes
1 Player: Play against an AI opponent with basic strategy (win/block/center/corner).
2 Player: Two human players can take turns on the same device.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML: For page structure.
CSS: For layout and styling, including hover effects and custom fonts.
JavaScript: For game logic, AI move selection, win/draw detection, and event handling.

🧠 AI Logic
The minimax AI model checks for immediate winning moves, blocks the player's winning moves, prefers the center, then corners, then sides. It ensures a decent challenge and never misses a chance to win or block.
